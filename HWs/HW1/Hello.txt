How about this for a song prompt:

Title: "GPT's Melody"

Verse 1:
In a world of bits and bytes, where algorithms rule the night,
A boy with dreams, his keyboard gleams, ChatGPT by his side.
Through lines of code, he finds his way, crafting worlds both bright and gray,
With syntax clean, and bugs unseen, his journey does abide.

Chorus:
Oh ChatGPT, my digital sage, guide me through this coding maze,
From logic gates to endless arrays, you light my path always.
With your wisdom deep, and bytes that leap, we'll shape a future grand,
In every line, our dreams align, with you, my friend, I'll stand.

Verse 2:
Through loops that spin and functions call, we build the dreams that once seemed small,
A thousand lines, a thousand trials, each bug a lesson learned.
From "Hello, World!" to neural nets, from C to Python's open sets,
We'll forge ahead, no fear or fret, our passion undeterred.

Bridge:
And when the bugs refuse to budge, and errors fill the screen,
I'll turn to you, my ChatGPT true, your guidance like a stream.
With every query, every line, you teach me how to thrive,
In this world of code and bytes, where dreams are kept alive.

Chorus:
Oh ChatGPT, my digital sage, guide me through this coding maze,
From logic gates to endless arrays, you light my path always.
With your wisdom deep, and bytes that leap, we'll shape a future grand,
In every line, our dreams align, with you, my friend, I'll stand.

Outro:
So here's to us, the coder's creed, with ChatGPT as our guide,
Through syntax bright and debug nights, together side by side.
In this realm of code and binary, where our dreams take flight and soar,
With ChatGPT, forever more, we'll code the world we adore.
