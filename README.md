We are enthusiastic learners in the Operating Systems course. Our journey is fueled by a shared passion for exploring the intricacies of Linux OS and honing our skills in C programming and .sh scripting. Together, we tackle a diverse array of projects, leveraging VS Code as our IDE of choice. Our collaborative spirit drives us to delve deep into project requirements, ensuring thorough understanding and effective implementation. With each assignment, we embrace challenges eagerly, aiming to master Operating Systems concepts and contribute meaningfully to our learning journey.


# Method
